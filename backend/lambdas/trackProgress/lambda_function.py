"""trackProgress Lambda

This Lambda is triggered on a schedule (e.g. nightly) to analyse a
student's recent answers and update their learningâ€‘style profile.  It
would read from a DynamoDB table of answers, compute statistics and
write back to a profile table.  Here we simply log that the function ran.
